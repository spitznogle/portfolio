```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website.git
cd portfolio-website

2. Open the website locally by opening index.html in a browser.

No server or build process required — it’s a static site.

On the Projects page:

Click the tabs to view different files (main.py, functions.py, data.py) per project.

Use the Copy button to copy code snippets to your clipboard.

The site is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop screens.
