      <h2>Hello, I'm Chasity!</h2>
      <p>
        I currently work as an <strong>Amazon Flex Driver</strong>, delivering packages efficiently while managing logistics on the go. This role has sharpened my organizational and problem-solving skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m enrolled as a <strong>Maestro student in the Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in AI Software Engineering</strong> program, with classes starting January 5, 2026. This program focuses on building practical software and AI skills through hands-on, project-based learning, helping me bring real-world app ideas to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also passionate about animals and care for them personally, taking in one dog at a time. My long-term vision is to grow <strong>Sage's HARK</strong>, a shelter and training program for dogs, but for now it’s on hold while I focus on day-to-day life and other projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my current technical projects is designing an app for Flex Drivers to help track routes, earnings, expenses, mileage, and more. I enjoy combining real-world experience with technology to solve practical problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy blogging on <strong>Haven Paw Prints</strong>, exploring music, reading, art, and spending time with my family.
      </p>
